It was based on the template [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose.

Note that this page uses the [TilburgsAns](https://www.tilburgsans.nl/) font but references it from the main site at [jqno.nl](https://jqno.nl). In development, it will fall back to a `sans-serif` font. See the font license [here](assets/tilburgsans/Ans%20Font%20License-AFL.pdf).
